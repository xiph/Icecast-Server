    Support listening on multiple sockets.

2003-03-08
    Support for shoutcast source protocol added.

2003-03-08
    Started implementing generic admin interface. Supports (so far): 
    - dynamic configuration of mount fallbacks
        /admin/fallbacks?mount=/mount&fallback=/fallback
    - setting of mp3 metadata
        /admin/metadata?mount=/mount&mode=updinfo&song=New%20Title
    - dumping raw xml stats
        /admin/rawstats
    - listing all connected clients on a mountpoint: 
        /admin/listclients?mount=/mountname

2003-03-05
    Implemented the ability to reread the config file on SIGHUP. For now, this
    does not affect configuration for currently running sources (only new
    sources and global parameters like max-listeners)

2003-03-02 
    More features:	 
    -- per mountpoint listener maxima   
    -- static configuration of mountpoint fallbacks   
    -- stream dumping (write incoming stream to disk)

2003-02-27
    Fix log buffering on win32 - previously, logs were never flushed, so they
    only got output every few tens or hundreds of lines.

2003-02-27
	Support new icy-audio-info header, to communicate various parameters to
    clients and yp servers, including sample rate, quality, channels, bitrate

2003-02-25
    Full support for relaying mp3 metadata (if turned on in config file)

2003-02-25
    Allow configuration of maximum client queue length (in bytes)

2003-02-14
    Finished full IPv6 support. 

2003-02-12
	Allow configuring local mountpoint seperately from remote mountpoint for
    relays

2003-02-12
	Per mountpoint usernames and passwords (for sources)

2003-02-11
	Now that it's been officially assigned, use application/ogg instead of
	application/x-ogg

2003-02-07
    Allow relaying of mp3 streams from icecast 1.x and shoutcast

2003-02-07
    Added ability to configure individual relays (rather than just all streams
    from a single server).

2003-02-03
    Added support for YP directory services listings
	are only used by the yp listing routines

2003-02-03
    Support command line parameter -b to run in the background (not supported
    on win32)

2002-12-31 
    Implement configurable mountpoint fallbacks (on source exit, clients are
    transferred to another mountpoint automatically, without disconnecting
    them)

2002-12-31
    Implemented full mp3 metadata support.

(older stuff is missing from here)
