Icecast2 Beta 2.

This is an beta release. Not all functionality is fully implemented, though
we believe it to be very stable for all the currently available features.

To build icecast on a Unix platform, perform the following :

Run
   ./configure
   make
   make install

To build and install this release.

A sample config file will be placed in /usr/local/etc (on UNIX) or in the current working directory (on Win32) and is called icecast.xml

Documentation for icecast is available in the doc directory, by viewing doc/icecast2_TOC.html in a browser.

Please email us at icecast@xiph.org or icecast-dev@xiph.org, or come and see
us at irc.freenode.net, channel #icecast, if you have any troubles.
