### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          icecast
# Required-Start:    $syslog $remote_fs
# Should-Start: $time ypbind sendmail
# Required-Stop:     $syslog $remote_fs
# Should-Stop: $time ypbind sendmail
# Default-Start:     3 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 2 6
# Short-Description: icecast2 streaming server
# Description:       Start icecast2 to stream ogg/mp3
#	(The Short-Description should already be a good hint.)
### END INIT INFO
# 
# Any extensions to the keywords given above should be preceeded by 
# X-VendorTag- (X-UnitedLinux- X-SuSE- for us) according to LSB.
# 
# Notes on Required-Start/Should-Start:
# * There are two different issues that are solved by Required-Start
#    and Should-Start
# (a) Hard dependencies: This is used by the runlevel editor to determine
#     which services absolutely need to be started to make the start of
#     this service make sense. Example: nfsserver should have
#     Required-Start: $portmap
#     Also, required services are started before the dependent ones.
#     The runlevel editor will warn about such missing hard dependencies
#     and suggest enabling. During system startup, you may expect an error,
#     if the dependency is not fulfilled.
# (b) Specifying the init script ordering, not real (hard) dependencies.
#     This is needed by insserv to determine which service should be
#     started first (and at a later stage what services can be started
#     in parallel). The tag Should-Start: is used for this.
#     It tells, that if a service is available, it should be started
#     before. If not, never mind.
# * When specifying hard dependencies or ordering requirements, you can 
#   use names of services (contents of their Provides: section)
#   or pseudo names starting with a $. The following ones are available
#   according to LSB (1.1):
#	$local_fs		all local file systems are mounted
#				(most services should need this!)
#	$remote_fs		all remote file systems are mounted
#				(note that /usr may be remote, so
#				 many services should Require this!)
#	$syslog			system logging facility up
#	$network		low level networking (eth card, ...)
#	$named			hostname resolution available
#	$netdaemons		all network daemons are running
#   The $netdaemons pseudo service has been removed in LSB 1.2.
#   For now, we still offer it for backward compatibility.
#   These are new (LSB 1.2):
#	$time			the system time has been set correctly	
#	$portmap		SunRPC portmapping service available
#   UnitedLinux extensions:
#	$ALL			indicates that a script should be inserted
#				at the end
# * The services specified in the stop tags 
#   (Required-Stop/Should-Stop)
#   specify which services need to be still running when this service
#   is shut down. Often the entries there are just copies or a subset 
#   from the respective start tag.
# * Should-Start/Stop are now part of LSB as of 2.0,
#   formerly SUSE/Unitedlinux used X-UnitedLinux-Should-Start/-Stop.
#   insserv does support both variants.
# * X-UnitedLinux-Default-Enabled: yes/no is used at installation time
#   (%fillup_and_insserv macro in %post of many RPMs) to specify whether
#   a startup script should default to be enabled after installation.
#   It's not used by insserv.
#
# Note on runlevels:
# 0 - halt/poweroff 			6 - reboot
# 1 - single user			2 - multiuser without network exported
# 3 - multiuser w/ network (text mode)  5 - multiuser w/ network and X11 (xdm)
# 
# Note on script names:
# http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/refspecs/LSB_1.3.0/gLSB/gLSB/scrptnames.html
# A registry has been set up to manage the init script namespace.
# http://www.lanana.org/
# Please use the names already registered or register one or use a
# vendor prefix.
