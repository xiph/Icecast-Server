icecast2 for Debian
-------------------

In the Debian packaging the configuration files have been symlinked from
the upstream location below /usr/share to /etc. This is needed to
satisfy FHS (/usr/share are for static content only).
If running icecast2 in a chroot environment, beware that the symlinks to
/etc will break. A possible (untestet!) solution might be to manually
put the configuration files back below /usr/share - and revert the hack
again before updating the package!

It is recommended to run icecast under a dedicated user account, which only
has access to write the log files.  The Debian package creates such an
account, named 'icecast2', and uses it by default, but you are free to
reconfigure it and remove the account.

Edit /etc/default/icecast2 to change the init-script configuration.

It is possible (but discouraged for security reasons) to bind to a
privileged port (like standard web port 80). Edit /etc/init.d/icecast2
to not change userid and instead set the correct userid and group in
/etc/icecast2/icecast2.xml. Beware that this way you rely on the
icecast2 binary to properly drop privileges (instead of the much more
thoroughly audited start-stop-daemon). Thanks to JÃ¼rgen A. Erhard
<jae@jerhard.org> for the tip.
