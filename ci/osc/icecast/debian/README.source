Building this package for Debian
--------------------------------

This source package uses quilt to apply and remove its patches.  Please
refer to /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source for information about how to
use quilt for source packages.


Developing this package for Debian
----------------------------------

The source of this package is developed using Subversion and the helper
tool svn-buildpackage in mergeWithUpstream-mode.  This is documented
below /usr/share/doc/svn-buildpackage/HOWTO.html/ .

A custom build target shows current upstream and packaging versions:

    debian/rules print-version

Current upstream tarball can be prepared using this other build target:

    debian/rules get-orig-source

To switch to newer upstream source, first add a dummy changelog entry
and comment out DEB_UPSTREAM_TARBALL_MD5 before getting the source:

    dch -v ${new_upstream_version}-1 "Dummy changelog entry"
    sed -i -e 's/^\(DEB_UPSTREAM_TARBALL_MD5\b\)/#\1/' debian/rules
    debian/rules get-orig-source

Store new md5sum to help ensure identical source is received later.


Developing this package for Debian
----------------------------------

Setting DEB_MAINTAINER_MODE=1 enables additional build routines helpful
during development of the package, but unfit for normal builds.  This
typically includes the CDBS feature of auto-updating debian/control with
CDBS-related build-dependencies, which is forbidden by Debian Policy as
build environment must not change during automated builds.


Maintaining packaging build routines
------------------------------------

This source package wraps debhelper commands and other tedious parts of
the build routines using the CDBS framework.  Please refer to the actual
makefile snippets included from debian/rules for details on their
purpose and ways to override defaults.  Additionally, makefile snippets
included from below /usr/share/cdbs may also be documented in
/usr/share/doc/cdbs/cdbs-doc.pdf.gz .
