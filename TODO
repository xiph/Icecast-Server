2.0 CRITICAL - These are the things without which 2.0 cannot be released
____________

- make install doesn't install everything. Needs to set up config file to point
  at appropriate places, install web directory somewhere, put config file
  somewhere. Should icecast automatically (i.e. without needing -c) look for
  the config file in /etc/icecast.xml or something?

- libshout 2.0 and ices 2.0 releases, also an ices 0.x release that works with
  this. Without source clients, icecast isn't much use...

- integrate/include all the documentation done by external groups.


BUGS
----
- stats get off?  this needs testing more testing.

- some stuff (like 'genre') isn't making it into the stats dump

- make install - doesn't install configs?

- logging - bytes send and time listening may both be broken?

FEATURES
--------

- pull out vorbis comments.  and send to stats. This seems to be being
  done, but it isn't working right.

- directory server GUID checks
	directory server does GET /GUID-asldjfasldfjalsdkfjasldkfj HTTP/1.0
	and either gets a 404 if it's wrong, or a 200 if it's correct.

- adding new stats type, event.  events don't modify the global stats tree,
	ie, source /1234.ogg disconnected

- support W3C Extended Logging (http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html)
	toggle between this and Apache Combined Log Format in the config file.
	default to apache style.

- allow using get_predata() stuff to send an "intro" to any newly-connected
  user?

- stats to list currently connected clients: ip and hostname

- stream switching (drop clients to another stream on disconnect of source)
  - a) fallbacks from named location to new mountpoint
  - OR b) fallbacks for connected clients to new mountpoint (so newly-connecting
       clients just get a 404 on the old path)
  - OR c) combination - first one, plus generic alias ability?

- /admin/* for all admin functionality
  - configuring fallbacks
  - mp3 metadata injection
  - remote shutdown?

- general registerable url-handlers in connection.c rather than hard-coded list
  (already getting unmaintainable)

- httpp - split out query string for further processing

- option to use ipv6 (equiv to using <bind-address>::</bindaddress>, I think.

- abstract all admin functionality to a set of commands, and command handlers.
  Make /admin/* just parse according to a set of rules, and dispatch generic
  commands through that.
  Use this for alternative admin interfaces (GUI? telnet interface?)

- listener authentication (per mountpoint?)

- all timer-based functionality (yp updates, slave/relay checks) should have a
  single timer thread which dispatches events through the normal event
  mechanism (to worker threads from the main pool). This will reduce the
  extraneous thread count.

- atomic admin function to: set fallback from A->B, remove A, move mountpoint
  B to A. Needs forced-source removal first.

- race condition between avl_tree_unlock(pending_tree) and 
  thread_cond_wait(&fserv_cond) in fserv.c, it's a pain to fix but should be.

- do we need to use locks on the avl client_trees in source.c and fserv.c?
