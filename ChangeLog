2014-12-28 11:08:56  Thomas B. Ruecker <thomas@ruecker.fi>

	* Preparing for 2.5 beta1 aka 2.4.99.1

2014-12-25 12:45:46  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Nicer display of <metadata>
	  This adds a little bit nicer display of <metadata> to the stats.xsl
	  page and avoids broken display of <metadata> and <authentication>.

2014-12-26 21:57:50  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: Added support to admin/ interface to list <role>s
	  This adds support to list global and per mount roles on stats.xsl.
	  This isn't nicest formated but works.
	  This also adds <source>-like <authentication> with <role>s to
	  root node.

2014-12-26 11:04:22  Thomas B. Ruecker <thomas@ruecker.fi>

	* height-adjusted logo2 for NSIS installer

2014-12-24 09:03:26  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: avoid assignment discards 'const' qualifier warning
	  Untested. Please test.

2014-12-22 09:08:24  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Display username and role in listener listing
	  This adds display of role name and updates display of username in
	  listener listing of mount points on admin interface.

2014-12-22 07:58:37  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: corrected xsl to work in omode=normal

2014-12-20 18:48:03  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Allow <resource> to have only one of source and destination
	  This allows <resource> (former <alias>) to have only one of the
	  attribues source and destination. In that case other parameters
	  will be applied to the client but uri is not mapped.

2014-12-20 18:07:04  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Merge branch fix for <metadata> of relays.

2014-12-20 18:06:42  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

2014-12-20 16:12:27  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: memory leak and race condition fix

2014-12-20 15:30:26  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: memory leak, now also releasing reglist[] members

2014-12-20 15:29:53  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: memory leak now freeing null_device and global source_password

2014-12-20 13:40:44  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: Added missing includes

2014-12-20 09:39:26  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: Corrected display of "login" on status page
	  This corrects the creation of <authenticator> in the status output
	  and this way fixes the display of login link on status page.

2014-12-19 17:30:37  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Merged support for thread-less <role>s

2014-12-19 17:27:54  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: immediate mode for <role>s
	  This allows a <role> represented by a auth_t to run in "immediate"
	  mode. In this mode no thread is created for this <role>. This is a
	  major speedup.

2014-12-19 16:40:41  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Allow mangement of <role>s via admin/ interface
	  Updated admin/manageauth.xsl the way suggested by
	  0eb466b76ddd3996f0caad60e4a0a3d64dcf8f24.

2014-12-19 16:14:35  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Allow mangement of <role>s via admin/ interface.
	  This allows to manage <role>s via admin interface if the role supports.
	  Also format of admin/manageauth has been changed:
	  - <source> was renamed to <role>.
	  - mount parameter was removed.
	  - <role> got new parameters: type, name,
	    can-adduser, can-deleteuser, can-listuser.
	  - can-* parameters are bools ("true" or "false"). They should be used
	    to show or hide elements on the admin interface.

	* Ticket #2123 is nearly complet with this, just admin/manageauth.xsl
	  needs up be updated. Please close the bug in the commit that updates
	  admin/manageauth.xsl.

2014-12-19 11:28:49  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Also export type="" in stats.xml's <role>s

2014-12-19 11:22:36  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Added support to type="static" <role> to list user
	  This adds support to list the user for a static <role>.

2014-12-19 11:16:13  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Added support for management-url="" in <role>
	  This adds setting a URL for manegement of roles to the
	  framework. If no URL is given in the config file this 
	  defaults to internal (/admin/manageauth.xsl) interface if supported
	  by the backend.

2014-12-19 11:01:32  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: only export name="" on <role> if set

2014-12-19 10:44:24  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Export <role>s on stats.xml
	  This exports id and name of <role>s on stats.xml output. The <role>s
	  are in a <authentication> container tag and mimic the format
	  used by the config file.

2014-12-19 10:50:52  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Added a unique ID to each auth_t.
	  This added a unique ID to each auth_t instance so it can be
	  referred to e.g. by the web interface for mangement functionallity.
	  Mostly lifted from connection.[ch].

2014-12-19 10:31:08  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Cleanup: Removed a printf() leftover from debugging

2014-12-18 10:24:15  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: Always export <metadata> in stats.xml

2014-12-18 09:56:54  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Added: 'legcay' mode stats.xml.
	  Add '?omode=legacy' to any URI or <resource ... omode="legacy" />.
	* Please test.

2014-12-14 19:18:22  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: Fixed compiler warnings
	
2014-12-14 16:19:32  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Support command line arguments in <event type="exec">
	  This adds support to pass additional command line parameters
	  to called processes.

2014-12-14 11:01:39  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Fix: Send Content-Disposition:-header correctly

2014-12-14 09:27:49  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Regression Fix: Correction of old-style <authentication>.
	  Old-style <authentication> within <mount> didn't work for type="url"
	  as well as some other parameters due to confusion between "node"
	  and "child" variable.
	* Thanks for trilliot for pointing out! Should work now.

2014-12-14 08:25:16  Thomas B. Ruecker <thomas@ruecker.fi>

	* Some minor changes to README.md, added Opus and WebM

2014-12-14 08:19:58  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Cleanup: make strcmp() more explicit in _start_logging()
	  This avoids if(strcmp()) constructs in favor of if(strcmp() == 0)
	  constructs. This is aligned with coding style and will improve
	  readability of the code.
	  Thanks to miksago.

2014-12-14 08:18:24  Thomas B. Ruecker <thomas@ruecker.fi>

	* NEWS updated for 2.4.0 and 2.4.1

2014-12-13 19:10:20  Thomas B. Ruecker <thomas@ruecker.fi>

	* Fix for docdir issue with deb/RPM. Fixes #2121
	  Replaced docdir with otherdocdir and made it relative to
	  docdir. This seems to work for debian and plain make install.
	  Will test RPM later.

2014-12-09 16:08:27  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Feature: Extract metadata and export them to stats.xml
	* All metadata is now extracted from Vorbis streams and ICY streams
	  and exported as new <metadata> tag into admin/stats if specific
	  mountpoint is requested.
	* To testers:
	  - Please test with Ogg Vorbis streams.
	  - Please test with Ogg Vorbis + Theora streams.
	  - Please test chained Ogg streams.
	  - Please test with ICY streams.

2014-12-08 07:58:17  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Speedup: Don't copy data into event if there are no registrations
	* If there are no registrations that are added to an event the event
	  doesn't need to be emited as nobody cares anyway. We will do this
	  simple check before we copy data into the event object to avoid
	  unnecessary calls to strdup() and other allocation functions.

2014-12-08 00:39:57  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Added <event>: Unified handling of events.
	* <event> has been added and can be used within <kartoffelsalat>
	  both in <icecast> and <mount>.
	  <event> takes backend depending <option> child tags.
	  Currently supported backends:
	  - log: send message to error log.
	  - exec: executes a program or script.
	  - url: delivers the event via HTTP.

	* within <mount> <on-connect> and <on-disconnect> has been replaced by
	  <event>. Config parser can on-the-fly convert old tags.
	  Also <authentication type="url"> within <mount> has been fixed
	  for those cases with <option name="mount_add" .../> and
	  <option name="mount_remove" .../> which are now on-the-fly converted
	  by the parser to corresponding <event> tags.

	* Please also see TAGs added as per #2098. Some include hints for
	  documentation updates needed after this change. Those updates
	  should take place before 2.4.2.

2014-12-07 10:54:34  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Cleanup: Moved config re-read function into right place
	* Renamed event_config_read() into config_reread_config() and moved
	  it into cfgfile.c. This allowed to delete event.[ch].
	  event.[ch] will later be used to implement <event>.

2014-12-06 20:24:33  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Corrected Makefile.am to refect README rename and TODO deletion

2014-12-06 20:04:21  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* ACL: added {allow,deny}-all, support bool notation
	* Added {allow,deny}-all option to ACL parser. Setting this will
	  set {allow,deny}-{method,admin,web} to *.
	* Also allow boolean values (insteed of *) for {allow,deny}-{web,all}.

2014-12-06 19:47:54  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* renamed <alias> to <resource> as it is planned to extend the usage
	  of this tag. docs and default configs should be updated by those
	  taking care of them.

	* cleanup: don't include "httpp/httpp.h" if not needed

2014-11-29 12:41:19  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* cleanup: converted printf() into ICECAST_LOG_DEBUG() but commented
	out so they do not spam logs for normal users.

2014-11-29 11:39:39  Thomas B. "dm8tbr" Ruecker <thomas@ruecker.fi>

	* include <stdio.h> as FILE* is used in the header

2014-11-28 23:46:08  Philipp Schafft <lion@lion.leolix.org>

	* Wow. Mega patch!

	This patch *replaces* the authentication system completly.

	* What is new:
	- <authentication> in mount section is now a container object.
	- <authentication> in root and mount section may hold any number
	  of <role>-Tags.
	- <role> tags:
	  Those tags define a 'role' and it's ACL rules.
	  A role is a instance of an authentication module (see below).
	  <role> takes the following options. All but type are optional.
	  - authentication related:
	    - type: Type of the authentication module 
	      (values: anonymous, static, legacy-password, url or htpasswd;
	      symbolic constants in auth.h)
	    - name: Name for the role. For later matching. 
	      (values: any string; default: (none))
	    - method: rule is only active on the given list of HTTP methods.
	      (list of enum values: methods as recognized by httpp/ 
	      [e.g: get,post]; default: *)
	  - ACL related:
	    - allow-method: Allowed HTTP methods.
	      (list of enum values: methods as recognized by httpp/ 
	      [e.g: get,post]; default: get)
	    - deny-method: Rejected HTTP methods.
	      (list of enum values: methods as recognized by httpp/ 
	      [e.g: get,post]; default: *)
	    - allow-admin: Allowed admin commands. 
	      (list of enum values: admin command; default: buildm3u)
	    - deny-admin: Rejected admin commands. 
	      (list of enum values: admin command; default: *)
	    - allow-web: Allowed web pages. 
	      (values: empty or *; default: *)
	    - deny-web: Rejected web pages. 
	      (values: empty or *; default: (empty))
	    - connections-per-user: maximum number of simultaneous connections 
	      per role and username. This is only active on active sources.
	      (values: unlimited or number of connections; default: unlimited)
	    - connection-duration: maximum time of a connection. 
	      This is only active on active sources.
	      (values: unlimited or number of secounds; default: unlimited)
	  <role> takes <option> child tags. <option> tags contain a name 
	  and a value option.
	  Meaning of <option> tags is up to the authentication module.
	- <role>s are considered to build a stack. 
	  If a role returns with AUTH_NOMATCH the next one will be tried.
	- <role>s are tested in this order: mount specific, default mount 
	  specific, global, internal fallback.
	  Internal fallback is set to allow web/ access via GET, POST and HEAD
	  (only GET supported by this time) and rejects all other requests.
	- New authentication module: anonymous
	  This module matches all requests. No options taken.
	- New authentication module: static
	  This module matches with a static username and password.
	  It takes two <option>s. One with name="username" and one with 
	  name="password" to set username and password.
	  This replaces old style <*-username> and <*-password> tags.
	- New authentication module: legacy-password
	  This module matches with a statich password.
	  It takes one <option> with name="password" to set password.
	  This replaces old ICE and ICY (shoutcast compat mode)
	  authentication.
	- Parsing <authentication> in <mount> with a type set in a special way
	  to allow 100% backward compatibility.
	- Parsing of <source-password>, <admin-password>, <admin-user>, 
	  <relay-password> and <relay-user> in global <authentication>
	  for 100% backward compatibility.
	- <alias> is now proccessed very early. This enables them to be used
	  for all kinds of requests.

	* To Do List & What does not yet work:
	- type="url" auth: mount_add and mount_remove.
	  This should be replaced by an unique feature I would call '<event>'.
	- Admin commands manageauth and manageauth.xsl are disabled as they 
	  need more review: This code needs to be ported to support 
	  multiple <role>s per <mount>.
	- url authentication module can not yet return AUTH_NOMATCH.
	  This needs to be reviewed and discussed on how to handle this case 
	  best way.
	- Default config files needs to be updated to reflect the changes.
	  As this is quite some political act it should be done in dicussion 
	  with the whole team and permission of the release manager.
	- Docs need to be updated to reflect the changes.

	* How does it work:
	Code has been changed so that authentification is done early 
	for all clients. This allows accessing the ACL data (client->acl)
	from nearly everywhere in the code.

	After accept() and initial client setup the request is parsed. 
	In the next step all <alias>es are resolved. After this the client 
	is passed for authentication. After authentication it is passed 
	to the corresponding subsystem depending on kind of request.

	All authentication instances have a thread running for doing 
	the authentication. This thread works on a queue of clients.

	* Hints for testers:
	- Test with default config.
	- Test with diffrent authentication modules in <mount>.
	- Test shoutcast compatibility mode.
	- Test with new style <authentication> and any amount of <role> 
	  (zero to quite some).
	- Test <alias> lookup on all kinds of objects.
	- Test source level credential login into the admin interface.
	- Test shoucast style meta data updates.
	- Test playlist generation.

	* Thank you for reading this long commit message. 
	  Have fun reading the full patch!

	<svante.signell@gmail.com>)
	See: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=767542

2014-11-18 19:57:21  ePirat

	* Docs: 2.4.1 docs added

2014-11-18 10:17:16  ePirat

	* fix for memory errors when using a lot of headers

2014-11-18 08:51:03  dm8tbr

	* Comments in <http-headers> break things ATM.
	Moved the comment out to avoid this bug.
	Needs to be checked.

2014-11-17 19:20:57  ph3-der-loewe

	* subset of earlier patch so it can go into 2.4.1: disconnects
	stdio of <on-[dis]connect> scripts from server owned filehandles.
	* This is considered a security fix: if on-connect/on-disconnect
	scripts are used, file descriptors of the server process remain open
	and could be written to or read from. Most pressing STDIN, STDOUT,
	STDERR are handled. Further all file descriptors up to 1024 are closed.
	There is a remaining (much lower) risk in combination of either a
	malicious or susceptible script and FDs above 1024.

2014-11-10 10:46:55  ph3-der-loewe

	* patch to fix regression on header size with large headers introduced
	by support of <server-id> and <http-headers>. This should ensure we
	have at least space for 2kB of extra headers. Depending on function
	and call we may have much more space.

2014-11-10 08:23:34  dm8tbr

	* Update minimal config to also contain ACAO * header

2014-11-10 06:25:15  dm8tbr

	* Update default config: SSL, headers, default-mount

2014-11-09 10:55:29  dm8tbr

	* Updated default openSSL cipher string
	* https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Intermediate_compatibility_.28default.29
	* same Qualys result

2014-11-09 09:13:59  dm8tbr

	* Clean up default config

2014-11-08 16:23:26  dm8tbr

	* Applying patch by ph3-der-loewe, HTTP PUT requires content-type
	* In case of SOURCE we are lenient and thus quite some source clients
	don't send a proper content-type, especially if they only support mp3.
	* This was meant to be introduced in 2.4.0 already, sadly we missed it.
	* All source clients MUST send proper content-type after migrating to 
	Icecast HTTP PUT protocol.

2014-11-08 13:34:45  ph3-der-loewe

	* Fixed regression introduced in r18356 (CVE-2011-4612): client
	duration time is now correctly logged. PRIu64 MUST NOT be used with
	log_write_direct() as depending on platform PRIu64 may be using
	something not supported by __vsnprintf() of log/log.c.

2014-11-08 12:28:17  ph3-der-loewe

	* make use of sizeof() not explicit magic numbers

2014-11-07 23:10:43  ph3-der-loewe

	* fixing some compiler warnings

2014-11-07 22:06:06  ph3-der-loewe

	* updated some copyright headers

2014-11-07 20:56:04  ph3-der-loewe

	* fix for %z on win*. hope it doesn't breaky anything else.

2014-11-07 19:14:28  ph3-der-loewe

	* added warnings on empty and default values of <fileserve>,
	<hostname>, <location>, <admin> and <server-id>

2014-11-07 11:18:54  ph3-der-loewe

	* send errorlog (loglevel WARN) to stderr prior to opening the real
	logfiles.

2014-11-07 10:12:24  ph3-der-loewe

	* added support for type="" and status="" in <header> 
	(subelement of <http-headers>).

2014-11-07 02:55:57  ph3-der-loewe

	* Added support for <http-headers> within <mount>. 
	Also support merging of headers (normal mount + default mount).

2014-11-07 01:40:28  ph3-der-loewe

	* handle empty strings in config file better. Now empty strings are
	handled in: accesslog, errorlog, logdir, webroot, adminroot and
	hopefully all kinds of port.

2014-11-07 00:56:02  ph3-der-loewe

	* initial patch to allow adding user defined headers

2014-11-06 23:55:58  ph3-der-loewe

	* coding style and typo correcion

2014-11-06 12:02:00  dm8tbr

	* Be more verbose in case of fileserve off

2014-11-05 10:09:07  dm8tbr

	* applied patch to update the default ciphers to be more secure
	* tested this successfully against https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/

2014-11-03 19:34:10  ph3-der-loewe

	* applied patch to disable SSLv3 and SSL compression explicitly

2014-11-02 20:19:29  dm8tbr

	* fix JSON status API problems
	* Put the last item check into every filtered tag.
	* This way we shouldn't run into problems of this type anymore.
	* Also it should be easier to customize this way,
	if someone wants to filter differently.


2014-10-31 09:00:45  ph3-der-loewe

	* rename ICE_LISTEN_QUEUE, ICE_RUNNING and ICE_HALTING 
	so they have a prefix of ICECAST_

2014-10-31 08:46:58  ph3-der-loewe

	* LOG_{ERROR|WARN|INFO|DEBUG}() 
	  -> ICECAST_LOG_{ERROR|WARN|INFO|DEBUG}()
	* avoid collision with LOG_INFO that is defined as part of syslog.

2014-10-26 14:03:57  ph3-der-loewe

	* make <auth> in <mount type="default"> work if no <mount-name> is
	given.

2014-10-09 10:39:13  ph3-der-loewe

	* Replace the old logging macros with variadic argument macros. 
	  (patch by ePirat)

2014-07-23 16:55:57  dm8tbr

	* removed threadpool from example config
	  it is long gone and unused

2014-07-23 10:20:47  dm8tbr

	* Fix autogen.sh to work properly on Mac OS
	* Applying patch by ePirat

2014-05-06 05:23:42  dm8tbr

	* This is Icecast 2.4.0!

2014-05-06 04:53:24  dm8tbr

	* SECURITY FIX - Override supplementary groups if <changeowner>

2014-05-05 05:16:44  dm8tbr

	* Added <audio> for supported streams. TNX ePirat

2014-05-04 17:36:25  dm8tbr

	* status2.xsl, broken for a decade, now it's gone!

2014-05-04 17:09:59  dm8tbr

	* Updated docs: 
	  * logging to STDERR; known issues

	* Adding stream_start_iso8601, server_start_iso8601
	  ISO8601 compliante timestamps for statistics. Should make usage in
	  e.g. JSON much easier.
	  Added as new variables to avoid breaking backwards compatibility.

2014-05-04 05:16:00  dm8tbr

	* Nicer looking tables for the admin interface.
	  ePirat sent updated tables code that should look much nicer.
	  This is admin interface only (and a global css change).

2014-03-09 13:02:35  dm8tbr

	* Set content-type to official "application/json"

2014-03-09 12:27:58  dm8tbr

	* Initial JSON status transform.
	  Output roughly limited to data also visible through status.xsl.

2014-03-09 12:26:15  dm8tbr

	* Silence direct calls, add partial array support.
	* The XSLT will now return empty if called directly.
	  This is a security measure to prevent unintended data leakage.
	* Adding partial array support to print sources in an array. 
	  Code lifted from: 
	  https://code.google.com/p/xml2json-xslt/issues/detail?id=3

2014-03-09 12:19:35  dm8tbr

	* Adding xml2json XSLT, svn r31 upstream trunk.
	  https://code.google.com/p/xml2json-xslt/

2014-03-01 17:53:00  dm8tbr

	* Icecast 2.4 beta5 aka 2.3.99.5

2014-03-01 17:37:38  dm8tbr

	* Reverting r18945 for now as using -b breaks things.
	  Reopening #1886, patch needs rework.

2014-03-01 16:38:15  dm8tbr

	* Web output properly redone, credit to ePirat.
	  Now validates completely as XHTML1.0 strict.
	  Also improves rendering on mobile devices.

2014-01-23 06:23:42  dm8tbr

	* Updated web interface to be more XHTML compliant.
	* Added warning about HTML scraping to main page.

2014-01-12 21:09:04  ph3-der-loewe 

	* Fixed a memory leak. Lost headers of stream because of wrong ref
	counter in associated refbuf objects.

2014-01-12 12:29:27  ph3-der-loewe

	* Completed HTTP PUT support, send 100-continue-header,
	if client requests it. We need to adhere to HTTP1.1 here.

2014-01-12 12:09:59  ph3-der-loewe   

	* avoid memory leak in _parse_mount() when "type"-attribuet is set

2013-11-06 01:01:31  ph3-der-loewe   

	* corrected Date-header format to conform the standard (see RFC1123).
	Thanks to cato for reporting.

2013-05-29 08:22:06  dm8tbr

	* Added a favicon to the web-root content

2013-05-15 16:45:55  dm8tbr   

	* We now split handling of command line arguments into two parts.
	Only the critical part of getting the config file is done first (and
	-v as it prevents startup). The rest (currently only -b) is deferred.
	It allows us to log error messages to stderr even if the -b argument
	is passed. This is mainly for the case where the logfile or TCP port 
	can't be opened.

2013-04-06 05:00:00  dm8tbr  

	* Icecast 2.4 beta3 aka 2.3.99.3

2013-04-05 20:13:18  dm8tbr

	* Edited warning for clarity.

2013-04-05 19:49:13  ph3-der-loewe

	mountname is set

2013-04-05 16:44:51  dm8tbr

	* Setting Icecast version to 2.3.99.3 in preparation for 2.4 beta3.

2013-04-05 16:43:16  dm8tbr

	* Add warning when using generic handler for stream sent to Icecast.
	All bets are off, we're trying our best using legacy handling code.

2013-04-03 02:04:38  

	* avoid fnmatch() on _WIN32 and fall back to strcmp(). Seems that
	MinGW does half-implement fnmatch()...

2013-04-03 00:46:55  ph3-der-loewe

	* do fuzzy(fnmatch) matching for mountpoint names of non-normal
	mounts, see #1914

2013-04-03 00:33:10  ph3-der-loewe

	* mount points defined in config should use data from default mounts
	as well, see #1914

2013-04-02 18:46:44  ph3-der-loewe

	* Added support for a default mount. See #1914.
	The default mount is a block in the config file that contains settings
	for all mount points that do not have a block in configfile themself.
	This is implemented by a <mount type="default">-block.
	In this case the <mount>-block MUST NOT contain 
	a <mount-name>-subblock.


2013-04-02 12:19:33  

	* Throw away the reqbuf stuff as it was not well designed. Removing it
	and restoring usage of %H to properly address #1916

2013-04-02 11:51:47  ph3-der-loewe

	* make use of const keyword in _fatal_error()

2013-04-02 11:48:40  ph3-der-loewe

	* allow --version as alias to -v (printing version number)

2013-03-30 10:52  dm8tbr

	* trunk/icecast/ChangeLog:
	* trunk/icecast/configure.i:

	* trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_config_file.html:
	Adding "A word of warning" to Icecast config file documentation.

2013-03-29 15:07:33  dm8tbr

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c:
	Highly experimental HTTP PUT support. ref #1812
	We are handling it the same as we would handle a SOURCE request.
	Due to legacy code, sender MUST send proper content-type header,
	if content type is not audio/mpeg!
	Can be tested using real-time encoded output and piping it into
	 
	| curl -u username:password -H "Content-type: application/ogg" -T - \
	http://localhost:8000/mountname.ogg
	 
	Note that this example has ZERO timing, so a simple 'cat *.ogg' will
	fail.
	Whatever feeds the pipe must do it at proper timing for real-time
	playback!

2013-03-29 14:41:24  dm8tbr

	* trunk/icecast/src/logging.c:

	  treat all clients as duplicates.

2005-09-08 14:03  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/win32/icecast.dsp,
	  trunk/icecast/win32/icecast2.iss: updates for rc2 build

2005-09-08 13:43  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c: if the m3u link is placed in
	  winamp/fb2k, then the host header misses the port number, so
	  I'll add a check that ignores the host header if it's missing a
	  port and generates the m3u host:port from the xml.

2005-09-08 13:32  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c: do
	  proper cleanup on odd cases of source client startup, also take
	  mutex lock for client_create at relay startup to prevent race

2005-09-01 16:11  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth.c, trunk/icecast/src/auth.h: immediately
	  release auth_t if authentication fails, that way we don't
	  trigger release_client like listener_remove event in the url
	  auth. Add lock in auth_t so that refcount changes are not a race
	  possibility.

2005-08-31 01:28  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c: 2 updates to mp3 metadata
	  handling. allow a 0 metadata interval to disable metadata being
	  sent to new listeners (negative for whatever the source sends),
	  existing listeners retain their original interval setting. We
	  now limit how much mp3 is written after the metadata block in a
	  single format send call, this was only showing up on small
	  interval values.

2005-08-31 01:13  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/admin.c: content was wrong due to limiter
	  being 0

2005-08-30 20:29  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth_htpasswd.c: Fix bug reported by
	  Jason@weatherserver.net - don't crash in htpasswd auth if the
	  auth file doesn't exist.

2005-08-30 00:30  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/yp.c: extra checks on YP updating, typically
	  on changes over HUP

2005-08-29 01:16  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/refbuf.c, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c: fix
	  double free bug with failed to start relays and add a guard on
	  refbuf release

2005-08-27 01:01  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/slave.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c: minor
	  memory leak, and compiler warning cleanup

2005-08-25 01:03  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c: hide fallback file from webroot
	  stats, still accessible from admin. Missed log debug line from
	  apply function

2005-08-25 00:07  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth.c, trunk/icecast/src/client.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format.c, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c: fixes for client handling, these are
	  all related to the handling of max clients. I've taken out the
	  client_create out of the connection_complete_source and put it
	  in slave, that way we can control the cleanup of the
	  memory/socket better, the change also meant fallback to file
	  tests were slghtly different.

2005-08-23 10:48  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Some versions of gcc complain about
	  the missing cast here; it's apparently needed because some
	  systems don't define NULL as a pointer (weird). Patch from
	  Moritz Grimm.

2005-08-12 15:27  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/client.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c, trunk/icecast/src/fserve.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/stats.c, trunk/icecast/src/stats.h: make
	  various responses going back to the client be done via the file
	  serving thread

2005-08-12 03:27  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/xslt.c: make sure that older xslt libs on
	  non-win32 can be used as well

2005-08-12 02:40  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth.h, trunk/icecast/src/auth_url.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.h, trunk/icecast/src/main.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c: merge in client timelimit, only
	  auth_url sets this currently. Add missing prototypes for compile
	  warning

2005-08-11 23:49  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/win32/Icecast2win.dsp,
	  trunk/icecast/win32/icecast.dsp,
	  trunk/icecast/win32/icecast2_console.dsp: misc build updates for
	  trunk

2005-08-11 23:48  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth_url.c: compiler error on win32

2005-08-11 23:29  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/client.c, trunk/icecast/src/client.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c: drop the thread pool of connection
	  threads, they were using a blocking socket on incoming
	  connections. Now we get the accept thread to create a client_t
	  and mark it as a shoutcast client if need be. Then use a single
	  connection thread to poll the non-blocking sockets for the
	  headers. When complete they get handled as usual.

2005-08-11 23:17  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/logging.c: memory leak fix..

2005-08-11 23:11  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth_url.c: change the option names to be more
	  reasonable

2005-08-11 22:56  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth.c, trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/main.c: a few fixes needed after some testing
	  on win32

2005-08-11 20:31  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/xslt.c: xlst function so that win32 can use an
	  older version of libxslt...

2005-08-09 02:55  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c: make sure we have the initial
	  listeners stat

2005-08-09 02:14  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/admin.c, trunk/icecast/src/client.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/yp.c: merge fixes. NULL checks

2005-08-08 19:21  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c, trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_vorbis.c: Merge mp3 packing. mp3 (and
	  other pass-through streams) can bre received in very small
	  blocks and go out in those same small blocks increasing the
	  protocol overhead used by the provided. Generally occurs when
	  using a low bitrate stream and many listeners. With this patch
	  we pack out a refbuf before queuing. Add missing include for
	  vorbis build that shows on some platforms

2005-08-08 18:39  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c: allow for webroot requests to be
	  sent via an authenticator

2005-08-07 23:29  karl

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in, trunk/icecast/src/Makefile.am,
	  trunk/icecast/src/auth.c, trunk/icecast/src/auth_url.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/auth_url.h: merge URL listener auth

2005-08-07 23:01  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/Makefile.am, trunk/icecast/src/admin.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/auth.c, trunk/icecast/src/auth.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/auth_htpasswd.c,

	  trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.h, trunk/icecast/src/client.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/client.h, trunk/icecast/src/connection.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/main.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.h: Initial auth merge. Add an auth
	  thread (multiple threads can be done later) which can be used to
	  handle authentication mechanisms without taking locks for long
	  periods. Non-authenticated mountpoints bypass the auth thread.
	  The lookup/checking of the source_t is done after the
	  authentication succeeds so the fallback mechanism does not
	  affect which authenticator is used. This can be extended to
	  allow us to authenticate in webroot as well. XML re-read changes
	  will take effect immediately for new listeners but existing
	  listeners will use the original auth_t (refcounted) when they
	  exit. htpasswd access has been seperated out from auth.c, and
	  implements an AVL tree for a faster username lookup. The
	  htpasswd file timestamp is checked just in case there are
	  changes made externally

2005-08-07 14:50  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth.h, trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/client.h, trunk/icecast/src/connection.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format.c, trunk/icecast/src/format_ogg.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_ogg.h, trunk/icecast/src/refbuf.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c: merge extra checks. minor cleanup
	  work

2005-07-26 13:15  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/logging.h: Fix for bug #688 as supplied by
	  moinakg2002@yahoo.com; make icecast compilable with Sun's
	  compiler

2005-07-04 20:11  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/stats.c, trunk/icecast/src/xslt.c: some xslt
	  related fixes. A small memory leak, a socket not closing on odd
	  case, and truncate the buffer length so that junk chars are not
	  sent back.

2005-06-27 02:10  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.c: merge fix, the per client intro
	  offset can be > 0, so we need to skip over some of the burst data

2005-06-25 12:27  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/admin.c: missed from previous merge, some
	  random chars at end of xml output

2005-06-19 13:50  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/yp.c: allow touch frequency setting to be
	  changed on any YP response. Also pass user agent to YP server

2005-06-18 10:54  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/admin.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/stats.c, trunk/icecast/src/stats.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/xslt.c: make admin and web root pages use file
	  serving thread to send back responses

2005-06-17 22:55  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/fserve.h: push HTTP header writing for file
	  download into file serving thread to prevent stalls in
	  connection thread. perform most file checking in fserve but
	  allow for m3u file override and using the Host header if
	  available.

2005-06-12 18:43  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/admin.c, trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.h, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c: small
	  cleanups. redundant mutex removed, updates to log messages

2005-06-11 17:21  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c, trunk/icecast/src/fserve.h: update
	  file serving setup and processing. Do http header writing in
	  fserve thread by using generic write routine. small leak plugged
	  on failure case. extend mime type handling slightly for rare case

2005-06-11 01:24  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.h, trunk/icecast/src/stats.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/stats.h: update a few stats

2005-06-10 18:01  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/sighandler.c: this is needed for linuxthreads,
	  without it, zombie processes are left when on-[dis]connect is
	  used

2005-06-10 15:42  karl

	* trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_config_file.html,
	  trunk/icecast/src/client.c, trunk/icecast/src/format.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c, trunk/icecast/src/fserve.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c: merge in fallback to file, override
	  also works

2005-06-10 00:37  karl

	* trunk/icecast/conf/icecast.xml.in,
	  trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_config_file.html,
	  trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c, trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/sighandler.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c:
	  merge per-mount on-[dis]connect script handling

2005-06-09 20:54  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/stats.c: add a few
	  more informational stats

2005-06-09 15:44  karl

	* trunk/icecast/conf/icecast.xml.in: might as well add these to
	  the samples configs

2005-06-09 15:32  karl

	* trunk/icecast/conf/icecast.xml.in, trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c:
	  increase default max queue size, 100k isn't much and we do
	  reduce it when there are no lagging clients

2005-06-09 13:29  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c: don't be too quick when dealing with
	  files. allow the limited per-client loop but don't trigger a
	  small poll timeout

2005-06-09 13:05  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c: send StreamTitle in metadata
	  when reading from intro file

2005-06-09 04:05  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth.c, trunk/icecast/win32/icecast.dsp,
	  trunk/icecast/win32/icecast2_console.dsp: gotta love windows..
	  _snprintf is *much* more readable than snprintf (not)... also,
	  some updates to the VC project files

2005-06-09 02:21  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth.c: using .filename causes problems with
	  absolute paths for the temp file, also test to see if file
	  exists already

2005-06-09 01:51  karl

	* trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_config_file.html,

	  trunk/icecast/src/slave.h, trunk/icecast/src/source.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.h: merge in the on-demand relay
	  implementation.

2005-06-08 04:18  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/win32/Icecast2win.dsp,
	  trunk/icecast/win32/icecast.dsp: updates for latest trunk

2005-06-08 01:36  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/client.c, trunk/icecast/src/client.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/format.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format.h, trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_ogg.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Do
	  normal http header writing in source thread instead of the
	  connection thread, this will allow on-demand relays to fail and
	  still handle the initial listener correctly (fallback or 404
	  response).

2005-06-06 15:39  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c: send StreamTitle in the initial
	  metadata block, if not real/helix has trouble with playback

2005-06-03 15:35  karl

	* trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_config_file.html,

2005-05-31 02:48  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.c, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/yp.c: missed a merge for stats update for when
	  the relay ends. The rest is minor stuff, type check cleanup and
	  code reduction in YP

2005-05-31 02:40  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c: send response header to stats
	  client

2005-05-30 14:50  karl

	* trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_config_file.html,
	  trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c, trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.h,

	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/yp.c, trunk/icecast/src/yp.h: allow for more
	  updating over HUP. Made the YP engine only read the stats
	  instead of updating them, so source header parsing is done in
	  the apply mount. Per-mount stream settings also allow for
	  overriding the incoming settings.

2005-05-26 03:04  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.c,

	  trunk/icecast/src/slave.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.h, trunk/icecast/src/yp.c: various
	  small things. type cleanups, loop over the burst point to make
	  sure it is at the right point. kick off the YP 'add' 5 seconds
	  after source startup so that any stats are processed.

2005-05-25 01:43  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/logging.c, trunk/icecast/src/logging.h: fix
	  win32 access.log entries, the rest is just cosmetic

2005-05-16 00:16  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/event.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/slave.c, trunk/icecast/src/slave.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.h: use
	  minimal stats for inactive mountpoints that have an active
	  fallback.

2005-05-13 00:35  karl

	* trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_config_file.html,
	  trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c, trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c: Allow
	  for username to be stated for master/slave setups, we still
	  default to 'relay' though

2005-05-10 00:28  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c, trunk/icecast/src/fserve.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/util.c, trunk/icecast/src/util.h: removed
	  redundant function, add total files requested to stats

2005-05-08 14:27  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/Makefile.am: missed header for dist tarball

2005-05-08 13:51  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/client.c, trunk/icecast/src/client.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/compat.h, trunk/icecast/src/format.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c, trunk/icecast/src/format_ogg.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.h: use a
	  client function to read an incoming stream, simplifies handling
	  within the format specific files. Also add total read/sent stats
	  per mountpoint. Updates the stats every 5 secs currently

2005-05-08 11:54  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c, trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c: add function to do mount list search
	  (could be extended later), call it from various places including
	  the shoutcast source client auth which previously only used the
	  global source password.

2005-05-07 20:18  karl

	* trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_config_file.html,
	  trunk/icecast/src/admin.c, trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c,

	  trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c, trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Allow for specifiying a per-mount
	  metadata interval for shoutcast style streams

2005-05-07 11:50  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/slave.c: allow for changes in relay settings
	  to trigger a relay restart

2005-05-07 11:01  karl

	* trunk/icecast/Makefile.am, trunk/icecast/configure.in,
	  trunk/icecast/src/Makefile.am, trunk/icecast/src/format_flac.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_flac.h,

	  trunk/icecast/src/format_midi.h, trunk/icecast/src/format_ogg.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_speex.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_speex.h: Add more Ogg codec handlers,
	  there has not been that much testing on these mainly due to
	  client support, but they are only for detection and plug
	  straight into the ogg handler. The win32 project files will need
	  updating to take the new files into account

2005-05-06 15:57  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/client.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/stats.c, trunk/icecast/src/stats.h: merge from
	  branch. push clients count handling to the
	  client_create/_destroy functions. call client_create in the
	  general handler and pass client_t to the specific handler
	  including the stats request handler, which now logs in the
	  access log.

2005-05-05 20:05  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/admin.c: from branch. make streamlist.txt from
	  the mount list, so that fallback handling can be taken into
	  account. If we just use the source tree then entries can
	  disappear causing a relay to shutdown in the slave.

2005-05-01 02:30  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c: safety check, avoid the case of a
	  cyclic cascading fallback

2005-05-01 02:04  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/stats.c: merge from branch, stats client
	  details are not being removed when they exit

2005-04-20 22:34  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c, trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/event.c: merge from branch, make the config
	  lock a rwlock instead of mutex

2005-04-18 14:32  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/admin.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c, trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_ogg.c,

	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/stats.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/xslt.c: merge in a few fixes and cleanups I've
	  accumulated in my branch.

2005-03-14 23:41  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/util.c: A bug report indirectly suggested the
	  base64 decode code was confusing (as the treatment of padding
	  was un-obvious), so added a comment explaining it.

2005-03-14 23:07  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Fix various places where "clients"
	  stats value was decremented without having previously been
	  incremented.

2005-03-11 02:20  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_config_file.html: Fix some docs for
	  bind-address: it was confusing in one point, and completely
	  wrong in another.

2005-03-03 04:20  j

	* trunk/icecast/debian/watch: fix debian/watch too

2005-02-28 01:08  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_config_file.html: Fix typos in
	  description of bind-address option. Fix second sentence so that
	  it isn't completely wrong.

2005-02-24 00:39  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/main.c: Remove references to -h option, which
	  doesn't exist, and which users could only ever find out about by
	  running a command that did what -h claimed to do.

2005-02-19 22:44  brendan

	* trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c: Whoops, don't spin if ufds is null.

2005-02-19 20:56  brendan

	* trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c: The poll version of
	  fserve_client_waiting causes icecast to die with an assertion
	  when it first starts up on OS X, because ufds starts out NULL.
	  I'd been using the select version until now and never noticed.

2005-02-16 00:54  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/xslt.c: Make a debug message into a warning
	  message, so it'll be logged more often (since it's useful), and
	  make it print out the file that it failed to find, so that users
	  can figure out what to do.

2005-01-21 06:44  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth.c: Fix spelling in debug messages.

2005-01-11 16:36  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/xslt.c: only unlock when we have finished with
	  the stylesheet, potential race otherwise

2005-01-03 17:48  karl

	* trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_yp.html, trunk/icecast/src/admin.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_ogg.c: small fixes

2005-01-03 17:36  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/win32/icecast2.iss: added auth.xsl to installer..

2004-12-29 18:02  giles

	* trunk/icecast/doc/icecast2_config_file.html: Correct a typo.

2004-12-21 20:06  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/icecast.spec: update of the spec file..

2004-12-21 19:36  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/ChangeLog, trunk/icecast/configure.in,
	  trunk/icecast/win32/icecast.dsp,
	  trunk/icecast/win32/icecast2.iss,

	* trunk/icecast/src/compat.h, trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c,

	  (yay!). You can now use the Shoutcast DSP as a source client.
	  The connection protocol is a bit odd, and we had to handle it
	  separately, and thus we've added a new config option
	  (<shoutcast-compat>) that is set at the listener port level. *
	  support for NSV (and the nsvscsrc source client). After adding
	  support for the connection protocol of the shoutcast DSP, adding
	  NSV was just a simple of a few special handling cases. * removed
	  all traces of the earlier attempt at the shoutcast DSP
	  connection protocol * Due to the growing complexity of the
	  config files, I've also created a few alternate config files,
	  namely one for a "shoutcast compat" setup as well as a "minimal"
	  one for quick basic configurations.

	  being found when the primary was disconnected (for
	  newly-connecting clients).

2004-06-02 19:34  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/yp.c: make sure YP entries are flushed out
	  when a source stops. Avoid segv on failed icecast startup and
	  add some log messages.

2004-05-26 02:37  oddsock

2004-05-11 02:24  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.c: Some servers apparently send a
	  Content-Type header of audio/x-mpeg. Make icecast understand
	  this.

	  YP server outage.

2004-05-05 05:05  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/auth.c: Use remove() then rename() only on
	  win32 - where it's required. Don't use it on unix systems, which
	  don't need it, and where doing _only_ rename() preserves
	  atomicity.

2004-03-23 23:34  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/web/status.xsl: Fix to default status.xsl: we were
	  looking for server_url as an attribute rather than an element
	  incorrectly in one place, this fixes it so that the link is
	  correct. Patch from Dave St John.

2004-03-22 03:41  brendan

	* trunk/icecast: externals can't use relative URLs. Just check out
	  the modules yourself for now...

2004-03-22 03:32  brendan

	* trunk/icecast: Let's see if svn:externals works with relative
	  paths

2004-03-22 03:04  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/TODO: Remove obsolete bits from TODO

2004-03-22 02:16  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/main.c: Make icecast keep parsing command line
	  options after -c. Error message if fork fails. All untested; the

2004-03-09 18:33  giles

	* trunk/icecast/src/compat.h: Include inttypes.h from the

	  non-C99 platforms.

2004-03-09 02:36  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in, trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Couple

	  broken, and didn't compile, and was unneccesary anyway. reverted.

2004-02-20 01:25  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/stats.c: Patch for preventing stats from
	  staying around too long - stats thread should only go to sleep

	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.h: Make

2004-02-10 04:29  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c: Another fix: the length of the
	  _string_ is not the same as the metadata length (the metadata is
	  null-padded out to a multiple of 16 bytes), so we have to deal
	  with that.

2004-02-10 04:20  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c: Oops. Fix null-terminator.

2004-02-10 03:50  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/admin.c, trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.h: Fire off stats event for

	* trunk/icecast/autogen.sh, trunk/ices/autogen.sh,
	  trunk/libshout/autogen.sh: fix issues with non-portable echo
	  flags and re-do the tests for automake version checking. The
	  enrironment var AUTOMAKE can be used to indicate the first one
	  to check for

2003-07-27 22:53  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/Makefile.am: We need to state both of these to

2003-07-27 01:13  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/Makefile.am, trunk/m4/xiph_curl.m4: remove

2003-07-25 14:29  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/global.h,

2003-07-24 23:45  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/sighandler.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/sighandler.h: avoid hitting the mutex's in the
	  signal handler, we could block, which is not something we want

2003-07-21 01:39  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.c, trunk/icecast/src/cfgfile.h: a move
	  over from config.c config.h. This is so that config.h can be
	  built by autoconf. config.h is also the name expected by the
	  convenience libs

2003-07-18 19:54  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/config.c: The xml cleanup occurs after this
	  anyway, and doing this here can cause bad things to occur when

2003-07-11 19:03  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c: don't terminate stream when debugging

2003-07-08 14:11  oddsock

2003-07-06 15:27  brendan

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.c, trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c: Move
	  MP3 headers back into format_mp3.c per Mike's desire. I removed
	  icy- support from the generic send headers function, as it is my
	  understanding that only MP3 sources use icy headers. PLEASE
	  correct me if I am wrong. I also added code in the mp3 function
	  to convert ice-audio-info bitrate to an icy-br header.
	  ice-audio-info is for YP, icy-br for clients. Perhaps we should
	  send both to clients though?

2003-07-05 06:36  brendan

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c: Write a newline after the m3u
	  entry (patch by Paul Bryan).

2003-07-03 01:39  brendan

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.c: Convert ice headers to icy headers

2003-07-03 01:36  brendan

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.c: When relaying MP3 we reported the
	  source metainterval as well as our own, causing stuttering in
	  some clients. Thank goodness icecast uses an odd metainterval,
	  or this bug would never have been discoverd :)

2003-07-02 19:47  brendan

	* trunk/icecast/TODO: updates

2003-06-29 18:12  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/yp.c: infinite loop/memory leak fix for
	  private streams when yp is enabled

2003-06-26 13:33  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/yp.c, trunk/icecast/src/yp.h: - add_yp_info
	  moved into yp.c - all yp adds/touches are now done within a
	  single thread. This should eliminate any "thread growth" issues
	  and make things behave much nicer when yp problems arise. We
	  should eventually change the add/touches to non-blocking
	  sockets, which will be needed for large numbers of streams doing
	  adds/touches.
	* trunk/icecast/src/main.c: - added startup of yp add/touch thread

2003-06-26 13:32  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/stats.c: - fixed small memory leak
	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.h: - moved
	  add_yp_info into yp.c - most of the yp processing now moved into
	  the yp add/touch thread - use ice/icy-public rather than
	  ice/icy-private to coorespond to libshout and general convention
	  - memory leak fixed with audio-info

2003-06-26 13:31  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/format_vorbis.c: - force touches when vorbis

	  updated via admin interface

2003-06-20 18:50  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c: handle error returned from

	* trunk/icecast/conf/Makefile.am,

	  pkgdatadir ($prefix/share/icecast) web and admin directories,
	  and builds icecast.xml accordingly. icecast.xml is now installed
	  in $sysconfdir/etc, and IMHO icecast should attempt to find a

	  can't.

2003-04-17 03:23  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/main.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c: printf to

	  be used up to the point at which logging is started, then
	  everything should go there. also added a new stat to represent
	  what is currently being sent to the yp server as "what's playing"

2003-04-17 01:03  karl

	* trunk/icecast/src/Makefile.am: admin.h is needed for the tarball

2003-04-11 03:14  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/conf/icecast.xml: new parameter for the

2003-04-11 03:00  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/util.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/yp.c: - fixed alot of yp logic. timeouts now
	  work properly so the tolerance of the unavailability of yp
	  servers is much much better now. - new icecast config option
	  <yp-url-timeout> to specify the timeout - url encoding is now
	  fixed so that the yp data is formatted much nicer (and is
	  correct :)) - added url encoding for some fields that were not
	  url-encoded - modified util_dict_urlencode() to not url-encode
	  the key (still does the value) - new curl option
	  (CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL) which prevents curl from using signals when
	  timeouts are hit. This new option needs curl 7.10 at least.

2003-04-10 14:28  msmith

2003-03-31 12:54  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/admin.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Implement
	  killsource admin command, to kill sources. Doesn't always do
	  much, ices (as an example) will auto-reconnect.

	* trunk/icecast/src/admin.c, trunk/icecast/src/refbuf.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.h: Remove
	  locking from refbuf: we used a single global lock for all of
	  them, which caused significant lock contention with many
	  sources. Further, a single refbuf is never used by more than one
	  source (and hence one thread), so the locking was unneeded. Fix
	  a nasty bug in source.c:_compare_clients() - was casting a void
	  pointer to the wrong type, and hence all the tree-maintaince
	  comparisons were totally wrong (but due to the exact nature of
	  the bug this wasn't causing any active problems until...) Add
	  another admin command to kill a client - remove it using an id.
	  Note that many clients will do auto-reconnect, so this may not
	  be sufficient on its own, we might need a ban (possibly
	  temporary) function.

2003-03-07 22:39  karl

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in, trunk/ices/configure.in,
	  trunk/libshout/configure.in: Add XIPH_CFLAGS which will be used
	  to pass compiler flags which you don't want to get clobbered by
	  things like make CFLAGS='....' The typical flags you don't want
	  clobbered are ones like -pthread

2003-03-07 14:57  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/News, trunk/icecast/src/admin.c, trunk/net/sock.c,
	  trunk/net/sock.h: Implement listing of all currently connected

	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.h, trunk/icecast/src/source.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/util.c, trunk/icecast/src/util.h: Split admin
	  stuff out into a seperate file, add various utility functions
	  there. rename util_url_escape to util_url_unescape, and write a
	  util_escape function that actually DOES escape things. Fix all
	  the callers of the function to call the correct one of these two.

2003-03-05 13:03  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/ChangeLog, trunk/icecast/News, trunk/icecast/TODO,

	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/util.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/yp.c: Allow rereading config files. Lots of
	  new locking happening so that it's safe to have the config file
	  disappear under the rest of the program Does NOT affect
	  currently-running sources at the moment

2003-03-04 08:31  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/conf/icecast.xml: Comment out dump file, people
	  don't want that on by default (I'm not admitting to just having
	  filled up /)

2003-03-03 13:09  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/refbuf.c: doh! This one compiles.

2003-03-03 13:04  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/refbuf.c: Fix buffer-queue length handling
	  (was missing from refbuf_queue_add, which it used as well as
	  refbuf_queue_insert).

2003-03-02 11:01  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/ChangeLog: Add a changelog file for the last ~2
	  months. Other committers: any new features, and any major
	  bugfixes, should be added in here, please. Try and keep it up to
	  date. Minor changes (particularly those not visible to the user)
	  and so on don't generally need an entry here - this should be a
	  usable summary of new stuff for the non-developer.

2003-03-02 10:36  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/config.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Fix various minor bugs in
	  per-mountpoint configs.

2003-03-02 10:18  msmith

	  a user.

2003-03-02 10:13  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/client.c, trunk/icecast/src/client.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.h, trunk/icecast/src/util.c: More
	  features: -- per mountpoint listener maxima -- static
	  configuration of mountpoint fallbacks -- stream dumping (write
	  incoming stream to disk) Fixed some warnings that other people
	  introduced.

2003-02-28 20:16  brendan

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in: Typo

2003-02-27 03:01  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c: whoops...stats can't have spaces in
	  them, since XML can't have spaces in the tags also, handle case
	  where a client sends a bad ice-audio-info string (variable but
	  no value)

2003-02-26 23:52  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/util.c, trunk/icecast/src/util.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/yp.c, trunk/icecast/src/yp.h: added parsing of
	  new icy-audio-info header which will be used to communicate
	  things like samplerate/quality/number of channels to icecast2.
	  This info will be then forwarded to the yp servers for better
	  stream info. also factored out some logic in source_main into
	  common functions added a few new routines into util.c (taken
	  from Brendan's updates to libshout)

2003-02-25 09:40  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c,

	  trunk/icecast/src/refbuf.c, trunk/icecast/src/refbuf.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/slave.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Max queue
	  length for clients is now a) based on total bytes in queue, not
	  total number of buffers in queue b) configurable (defaults to
	  100 kB) mp3 metadata relaying (inline). Untested.

2003-02-20 22:18  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c: Oops. Very broken password
	  checking, fix from Karl Heyes.

2003-02-17 13:01  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c,

	  creation - misunderstood requirements for unlocking rwlocks.
	  Move more checks and some other logic into source.c

2003-02-17 12:05  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.c, trunk/icecast/src/format.h,

2003-02-17 11:56  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Fix a serious bug with source
	  creation in relays when local-mount != mount, and fix a series
	  of locking bugs in source creation.

2003-02-15 01:13  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in: check for poll(2) in configure.

2003-02-14 13:39  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/format_mp3.c: Fix mp3 streaming for clients
	  not using metadata

2003-02-14 13:17  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.c: Oops. Pull a header print outside
	  the loop so the Server: header is only output once, not many
	  times.

2003-02-14 11:44  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/client.c: Fix bad log entries from relaying.

2003-02-14 10:31  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/format.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format.h: Fix incorrect use of enum that was
	  leading to crashes on source connect for unknown mimetype.

2003-02-13 11:29  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/net/sock.c,
	  trunk/net/sock.h: Better IPv6 support. Hopefully logging will
	  work correctly now. However, some things still won't work,
	  notably relaying (the relay can be ipv6, the server being
	  relayed _from_ may not be). I'll fix that some time soon.

2003-02-12 22:50  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c: Increase buffer size for IPs so
	  that logging works better for v6 clients.

2003-02-12 11:04  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/config.c, trunk/icecast/src/config.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/slave.c: Allow configuring local mountpoint
	  seperately from remote mountpoint

2003-02-11 14:23  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/TODO, trunk/icecast/conf/icecast.xml,
	  trunk/icecast/src/config.c, trunk/icecast/src/config.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/format.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/global.h, trunk/icecast/src/source.h: Per
	  mountpoint usernames, passwords, and some infrastructure for
	  other per-mountpoint configuration (some of these are given as
	  examples in the config file, but they aren't yet used).

2003-02-11 12:18  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.c, trunk/icecast/src/fserve.c: Now that
	  it's been completely officially assigned, use application/ogg
	  instead of application/x-ogg

2003-02-07 14:00  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/slave.c: Sigh. And another.

2003-02-07 13:56  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c: Grumble. Silly gcc.

2003-02-07 12:26  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/config.c: Free new config variables on
	  shutdown (forgot to add this before)

2003-02-07 11:56  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c: Add
	  format detection workaround for icecast 1.x, which is buggy and
	  doesn't send a content-type header.

2003-02-07 11:46  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/slave.c: Fix relaying. Oops.

2003-02-07 10:53  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/conf/icecast.xml, trunk/icecast/src/config.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/config.h, trunk/icecast/src/slave.c: Rearrange
	  some relaying code. Add ability to configure individual relays
	  as well (i.e. single stream, rather than all the streams from a
	  server).

2003-02-06 13:10  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/TODO, trunk/icecast/conf/icecast.xml,
	  trunk/icecast/src/config.c, trunk/icecast/src/config.h,

	  trunk/icecast/src/yp.c, trunk/icecast/src/yp.h,
	  trunk/net/sock.c, trunk/net/sock.h: Lots of fixes for screwy
	  code formatting, plus: make streams public by default, send
	  ice-private: 1 to make them private. However, default config
	  file has yp servers commented out. A little fix for compilation
	  on some solaris systems Redo some config file stuff: now all the
	  passwords are inside an element <authentication>, (though for
	  now they're also accepted in the old location), and added admin
	  username and password. Move some of the admin activities over to
	  using the admin passwords (admin action that affect a mountpoint
	  use the source password) Fill in some (but not yet all, maybe
	  i'll do that later) of the infrastructure for per-mountpoint
	  passwords. Fix lots of headers/code so that it works
	  properly/portably on non-win32 systems.

2003-02-05 14:31  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/win32/icecast2.iss: forgot to add libcurl to the
	  setup building script

	  structure now has additional fields, which are only used by the
	  yp listing routines

2003-02-02 14:32  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/logging.h: added reference to log.h, WIN32
	  needed it otherwise it would fail on finding prototypes

2003-01-15 05:58  brendan

	* trunk/icecast/acconfig.h, trunk/icecast/configure.in: OS X
	  10.2.3 doesn't define socklen_t. This version is compatible with
	  autoconf 2.13. I believe it should also work in 2.5x, although
	  the semantics of AC_CHECK_TYPE have changed.

2002-11-23 15:55  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/src/os.h, trunk/net/sock.c, trunk/net/sock.h:
	  win32 port updates to recent changes

2002-11-23 15:54  oddsock

	* trunk/icecast/win32/Icecast2win.dsp,
	  trunk/icecast/win32/Icecast2winDlg.cpp,

	  issued.

2002-10-06 09:57  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Previous bugfix was incorrect, and
	  made the problem worse, since it ensured it would be triggered
	  in certain cases, instead of merely making it dependant on
	  previous values written to the variable in those cases. Fixes
	  source disconnect on some (but very few) ogg bitstreams (the
	  vast majority of my files play fine)

2002-03-22 22:41  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c: Ouch. Serious bug found by
	  Ricardo Galli. When the cond var is signalled it will wake up a
	  thread. If all the connection handler threads are handling
	  connections, the signal will be ignored and clients will 'pend'
	  until another client causes the to signal again. We have to
	  check to see if there are more pending connections before
	  waiting on the signal again.

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c: We were triggering error logic when
	  no errors had occurred. Thanks to Ricardo Galli for finding this
	  bug.

2002-03-05 23:59  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/logging.h, trunk/thread/thread.c: win32
	  patches from Ed

2002-02-19 22:01  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.c: Comment audio/mpeg out until it gets
	  implemented, to avoid segfaults.

2002-02-14 00:58  jack

	* trunk/icecast/COPYING: Replace the placeholder with the real
	  license.

2002-02-14 00:41  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/stats.c: Fix race condition on thread shutdown.

2002-02-14 00:28  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/stats.c: Shut down the stats_connection and
	  stats_callback threads cleanly when stats_shutdown() is called.

2002-02-11 09:11  msmith

	* trunk/avl/avl.h, trunk/httpp/httpp.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/format.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format.h, trunk/icecast/src/format_vorbis.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/stats.h: Bunch of
	  fixes: - connections are now matched to format plugins based on
	  content-type headers, and are rejected if there isn't a format
	  handler for that content-type, or there is no content-type at
	  all. - format_vorbis now handles pages with granulepos of -1 in
	  the headers correctly (this happens if the headers are fairly
	  large, because of many comments, for example). - various
	  #include fixes. - buffer overflow in httpp.c fixed.

2002-02-08 03:59  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/main.c: Minor cleanup of 'static' functions.
	  Fixed usage bug where usage wasn't getting displayed properly.

2002-02-08 03:51  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/config.c, trunk/thread/thread.c: More win32
	  fixes.

2002-02-07 01:04  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/logging.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/os.h, trunk/icecast/src/source.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/util.c, trunk/net/resolver.c,
	  trunk/net/sock.h, trunk/thread/thread.c, trunk/timing/timing.c,
	  trunk/timing/timing.h: minor build fixes for win32 courtesy of
	  Oddsock

2002-02-06 07:52  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/stats.c: Factor out common code in stats.c.

2002-02-06 06:11  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/stats.c, trunk/icecast/src/stats.h: A very
	  slightly modified version of oddsocks function to support gui
	  stats updates. Basically stats_connection() was copied to
	  stats_callback() (i should probably factor out some of the code
	  here!) with the change that instead of sending stats to a
	  socket, it sends the event to a callback function.

2002-02-04 07:08  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.c, trunk/icecast/src/format.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/format_vorbis.c, trunk/icecast/src/source.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/stats.c: Two things: 1) vorbis tags (ARTIST
	  and TITLE) now appear in the stats. Oddsock did the first cut of
	  this. 2) stats bug fixed. if a stats value was NULL a segfault
	  occurred. strdup(NULL) is fun!

2002-01-21 04:28  jack

	* trunk/icecast/conf/icecast.xml, trunk/icecast/src/config.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/config.h, trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Add a
	  source-timeout config option and implement it. This prevents
	  lame sources from sticking around way too long. Default is 10
	  seconds.

2002-01-21 03:56  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Make it log to a file when the
	  source gets disconnected

2002-01-21 03:10  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c: Fix a stupid but that Oddsock
	  and Ciaran both found. When sources log in we weren't checking
	  to see if the mountpoint was already taken. Since the mountpoint
	  was the key in the avl tree, bad things happened.

2002-01-05 00:29  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/format.h, trunk/icecast/src/format_vorbis.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c: Thanks to Ciaran for realizing that
	  we werne't freeing the format plugins memory on source exits.
	  This caused a small but noticable memory leak. The fix was to
	  add a new method to the format_plugin object - free_plugin() -
	  and have the source thread call this on shutdown.

2001-10-29 15:53  jack

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in: Another fix. -mv8 is a Sparc-only
	  option, and gcc will barf if you use it on x86.

2001-10-29 15:32  jack

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in: One more try at this.

2001-10-29 15:02  jack

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in: Does this fix x86 Solaris?

2001-10-29 14:55  jack

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in: Fix SUN_LIBS to apply to x86 Solaris
	  boxen. Who knew someone actually used x86 Solaris :)

2001-10-21 16:13  jack

	* trunk/icecast/Makefile.am, trunk/icecast/configure.in,
	  trunk/icecast/src/Makefile.am: Fix broken CFLAGS handling.

2001-10-21 15:25  jack

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in, trunk/icecast/src/Makefile.am: Fix
	  lib handling.

2001-10-21 15:12  jack

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in: AC_CHECK_FUNC is stupid. It needs
	  the LIBS set already, and you can't pass in a set of libs to
	  use. So we save/restore for the call.

2001-10-21 14:19  jack

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in: A few configure.in fixes. *
	  -D_REENTRANT probably needed on all platforms. Let's not limit
	  it to Linux and Solaris. * AM_PATH_OGG|VORBIS had a slight bug.
	  We shouldn't update the LIBS until after we've detected
	  anything. Thanks to Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org> for finding
	  this.

2001-10-21 10:07  msmith

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in, trunk/icecast/src/source.c:
	  configure.in: solaris requires -D_REENTRANT. What about other
	  platforms? source.c: fix bug in handling non-fatal errors like
	  EAGAIN

2001-10-21 02:06  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/global.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/stats.c: Revert stacksize stuff and changes
	  for the thread module.

2001-10-20 22:48  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.c, trunk/icecast/src/global.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/stats.c: Fix icecast for changes in thread
	  module regarding stacksize. For icecast, the default stacksize
	  is unchanged (8k) until further testing on Solaris to determine
	  if a larger value is needed.

2001-10-20 21:29  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/Makefile.am: Forgot to add new compat.h to
	  Makefile.am. Fixed.

2001-10-20 21:28  jack

	* trunk/icecast/configure.in, trunk/icecast/src/compat.h,
	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.h, trunk/timing/timing.c,
	  trunk/timing/timing.h: Add check for stdint.h, since Solaris
	  doesn't have it. This is needed on Linux for uint64_t, but
	  Solaris defines this in sys/types.h. Use check where
	  appropriate, and also add typedefs for Win32.

2001-10-20 07:59  jack

	* trunk/icecast/TODO: Updated the TODO file.

2001-10-20 07:40  jack

	* trunk/httpp/httpp.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.c: Thanks to
	  Akos Maroy <darkeye@tyrell.hu> for this. These variables need to
	  be uppercase always in order to comply with the HTTP
	  specification. While not a problem internal to icecast, they
	  were slipping into the log files and breaking some
	  less-than-robust parsers.

2001-10-20 06:51  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/connection.h, trunk/icecast/src/main.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/stats.c: It's too bad we don't have a commit
	  script that smacks me upside the head when I do stupid things
	  like this.

2001-10-20 06:43  jack

	* trunk/icecast/src/config.c, trunk/icecast/src/connection.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/connection.h, trunk/icecast/src/format.c,

	  trunk/icecast/src/source.c, trunk/icecast/src/stats.c,
	  trunk/icecast/src/util.c: Win32 fixes. Look how portable this
	  was ;) Just header stuff and some defines. Whee!

2001-09-10 03:26  jack

	* trunk/icecast/HACKING: Add HACKING file for instructions for
	  building from CVS.

2001-09-10 02:56  jack

2001-09-10 02:55  jack

	* trunk/icecast/Makefile.am, trunk/icecast/conf/Makefile.am,
	  trunk/icecast/configure.in: Include configuration files in 'make
	  dist'

2001-09-10 02:58  jack

	* trunk/avl/.cvsignore, trunk/icecast/conf/.cvsignore,
	  trunk/icecast/src/.cvsignore: More .cvsignore
