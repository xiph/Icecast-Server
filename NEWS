Icecast 2.4 beta1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: While WebM and Opus are production grade, there are other pending fixes.

- Support for WebM video
- Support for Opus audio in Ogg
- Fixes for some race conditions
- Allow (standard strftime(3)) %x codes in <dump-file>. Disabled for win32.
- Dropped debian packaging directory as debian use their own.

Icecast 2.3.3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- security fixes 

 - Improved HTTPS cipher handling and added support for chained certificates.
 - Allow the source password to be undefined. There was a corner case, where
   a default password would have taken effect. It would require the admin to
   remove the 'source-password' from the icecast config to take effect. 
   Default configs ship with the password set, so this vulnerability doesn't
   trigger there.
 - Prevent error log injection of control characters by substituting 
   non-alphanumeric characters with a '.' (CVE-2011-4612). 
   Injection attempts can be identified via access.log, as that stores URL
   encoded requests. Investigation if further logging code needs to have 
   sanitized output is ongoing. 

- Bugfixes
  This is mostly a bug-fix release to flush out the accumulated fixes.

 - On-demand relaying - Reject listeners while reconnecting. 
    Fix stats for relays without mount section.
 - Prevent too frequent YP updates.
 - Only allow raw metadata updates from same IP as connected source 
   (unless user is admin). This addresses broken client software that 
   issues updates without being connected.
 - Minor memory leaks
 - XSPF file installation
 - Fix case of global listeners count becoming out of sync.
 - Setting an interval of 0 in mount should disable shoutcast metadata inserts.

- Authentication
  Sources can now be authenticated via URL, like listeners. Post info is: 
  "action=stream_auth&mount=/stream&ip=IP&server=SERVER&port=8000&user=fred&pass=pass" 
  As admin requests can come in for a stream (eg metadata update) these 
  requests can be issued while stream is active. For these &admin=1 is added
  to the POST details. 

- XSL update
  Automatically generate VCLT playlist like we do with M3U,
  the mountpoint extension is .vclt 

- Documentation updates. 

Icecast 2.3.2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Character set support.
Most non-Ogg streams (eg MP3) send metadata as Latin1 but it could be in other
character sets.  As icecast uses UTF-8, we need to convert to UTF-8 so that web
pages and stream directories render correctly,
  . Allow a per-mount <charset> setting.  For when source clients do not
  indicate which character set is in use.
  . a charset= parameter to the metadata request.
  . Default for non-Ogg content is now Latin-1 (aka ISO-8859-1),  Ogg content
  still use UTF-8.

- Authentication
  . Each mountpoint authentication is isolated so one mount authentication does
  not slow another mountpoint authentication down.
  . XSL pages can require authentication.
  . Add some sanity checks for incorrect settings.

- Listening socket update
  . Allow multiple ports to be allocated which allow multiple shoutcast source
  clients to stream on the same icecast instance.
  . No internal limit on the number of listen-sockets that can be used.
  . Allow for a listen-socket to be marked SSL capable. While any client could
  connect on these, the idea is really for /admin requests.
  . allow for a <listen-socket> to bind to ipv4 and ipv6. BSDs may require to
  the use of bind-address.

- XSL update
  . XSL pages include an xspf link for non-auth streams.
  . XSL pages in both webroot and adminroot can take a mount= arg to limit
  which stats are transformed.
  . XSL files can specify the content-type to return to the client. It is no
  longer fixed to html

- Updates for stream directory handling.
  . A stream is not registered with the directory until after the first minute
  has passed. some streams have been stuck in a connect/disconnect loop.
  . Increase retry time on failure, if the stream add is rejected then it will
  be down to a misconfiguration so a long retry delay is performed.
  . A YP server that is not responding is ignored for a while

- Updates for Win32
  . Build cleanups,
  . Newer versions of dependency libs (libxml2/libxslt/libcurl etc)
  . buffer overflow fixes when many streams are active

- Accept/Ban IP support.
Now takes filenames for explicitly accepting or denying requests from specified
IP addresses.  Useful in cases where firewall access is not available.  The
files, if defined, are re-read automatically if updated.

- A Mountpoint is exported to the slaves even if no mount section is defined for
it. You can still use the hidden setting to prevent that from happening.

- Relays handle redirection (HTTP 302) if one is received at startup.

- Automatically generate XSPF playlist like we do with M3U, the mountpoint
extension is .xspf 

- Header updates for proxy handling and certain clients like some shoutcast
source clients and flash players.

- Added Kate/Skeleton codecs to Ogg handler.

- Various stats cleanups. Added some global stats (server ID, email contact etc).

- Documentation updates.

- The streamlist passed from master to slave had a limited length, so if there
were many streams then some could of been left out.

- Relay startup/shutdown is cleaner.

- several build cleanups.

- several resource leaks and race conditions fixed


Icecast 2.3.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- new tag <logsize> in <logging> state the trigger size (in KB) for cycling the
log files.

- new tag <logarchive> in <logging> enable (1) if you want to use a timestamp
for an extension when cycling logs. 

- Handling of certain shoutcast source clients is fixed, this typically
affected NSV source clients

- A race in source shutdown when listeners are authenticated could lead to
server crash

- An audio glitch was possible in playback of vorbis streams when a new logical
stream started (eg metadata update).

- stats speedup. Processing large numbers of stats was slow. Typically only
seen when using lots of streams on the same server.

- 404 responses were being sent back in some places, now 403 is sent back.

- Auth URL now handles the authentication to scripts better.
  The order in which username/password are selected is
  1. url is http://user:pass@host:port/....
  2. <param name="username"> and <param name="password">
  3. with listener_add/remove, listener supplied username/password is used.

- A streams intro file can now be changed, using HUP, on active streams.

- mount without a name crashed the server

- Various documentation updates


Icecast 2.3 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**** New features for 2.3.0 ****

- Streaming support for ogg speex, ogg flac, ogg midi

- intro file support - per mount settable
   Intro files will play when a listener first connects to a stream.  This
   is designed for station jingles and the like.  If you don't broadcast 
   in ogg vorbis, you must make sure the bitrate/samplerate/number of 
   channels match up to your stream.

- on-demand relays, global and per-relay settable
   On demand relays only connect to the relayed content when there are
   listeners attached to the relay.  This can save bandwidth in certain cases.

- fallback to file, extends on the intro file handling.
   With this feature, you can specify a "fallback file" which will be played
   in a loop and sent your currently connected listeners in the event of a
   source client disconnect.  This means your listeners stay connected while
   you fix your disconnect problem.  Same rules regarding bitrate/samplerate/
   number of channels apply as with intro files.

- new mount-level settings
   1. public, type/subtype, genre settings, stream description,
      stream url, stream name, bitrate (override what is sent from the source
      client)
   2. mp3 metadata interval
   3. on-[dis]connect scripts can be stated per-mount, invoked at source 
      start/stop and take 1 arg which is the mountpoint.

- New URL listener authenticator.
   This delegates your listener authorization to an external application.
   URL calls are made on listener connect/disconnect as well as source
   connect/disconnect.  It is meant for large broadcasters who have existing
   authentication systems that need to be integrated into.  Included is 
   an example php-based application that can be used in conjunction with 
   the url authenticator to manage a simple subscription-based broadcast.

- HTPasswd authenticator uses in-memory structures now.

- On demand files now can be fed through an authenticator

- Update to admin/web xslt interface

- Icecast can now be installed as a win32 service

**** Fixes for 2.3.0 ****
- real/helix works
- win32 access log correct
- stats client is stable now (curl -X STATS http://admin@host:port/)
- show mountpoints on stats that are inactive but have an active fallback
- more updates over HUP possible
- improved stability under heavy load
- moving clients will no longer sometimes deadlock the server
- avoid small writes to reduce TCP overhead.


Icecast 2.2 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
****New features for 2.2 (in no particular order):****

- Theora Video support -
Icecast now supports video streaming via theora.  Currently, we require the latest
(alpha 4) version of libtheora.  This is an optional compile, so if you don't
have theora then icecast will safely ignore it

- Shoutcast style source client support -
Icecast now supports the connection protocol used by the Shoutcast DSP source
client.  This is the same connection protocol used by their NSV encoding tools.
This means that not only can you use the Shoutcast DSP to stream to icecast, but
that you can also stream NSV via their tools.

- AAC is added as a supported streaming format -
Not too many source clients support streaming in this format, but we support it.

- Cluster password -
Now you can specify a cluster password as a <mount> option in the config. This
will allow you to cluster multiple servers/mounts into a single listing on the 
stream directory.  Note that this is different than "grouping" which groups together
streams coming from the same physical IP and with the same stream name.  Clusters
are meant for relays of the same stream and will only be listed *once* in the stream
directory.  When a listener tunes into a cluster, they will be served an m3u file
with all the clusters for that stream.

- Playlist Log -
This is an option setting that will create an audit trail of metadata that comes through
icecast.  It is a single file that contains information for all mountpoints.

- Range Support for static files -
We now support seeking in files served off the icecast fserve.

- Metadata Update via Admin -
We now support metadata updates via the admin interface for both MP3 AND Ogg Vorbis
streams.

- Per mount hidden stats and YP prevention -
You many now indicate certains mounts to be excluded (i.e. hidden) from the main
status.xsl page.  This is useful when using local private relays.  You can also
override the YP setting (as in disable) on a per-mount basis.  Also useful for
local private relays.

- Multiple example config files -
We now have multiple config files for you to use as a base.  A "simple" one for 
quick-start, and a more detailed "advanced" one with all the features, as well
as a "shoutcast compatable" one, which shows how you'd config for using the
shoutcast DSP.

- Relay user/pass -
You can now specify authentication used by a relay.  This is for the case where
you have listener authentication enabled for a mountpoint, and want to connect
a relay to it.

Icecast 2.1 11/04/2004
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
****New features for 2.1 (in no particular order):****

-Listener Authentication-

  Icecast now supports listener authentication.  This provides a mechanism for
  creating/maintaining users and passwords for listeners.  Currently, we only
  have implemented a simple, file-based storage for users and passwords.  New
  authenticators are on the horizon (such as URL-based or possibly MySQL based)
  New admin pages were also added for the maintenance of users/passwords. Please
  check the docs for a more detailed description of this new feature.

-Multi-Level Fallbacks-
 
  Multi-level fallbacks allow for specifications of a series of fallback mounts
  that you can use to automatically move listeners in the event of a source being
  disconnected.  In the event of new listeners attaching to the source stream that has
  been disconnected, they are routed to the fallback mount (if specified).
  Icecast now has fallback-override capability as well which means that in the event
  of a source stream failure, listeners are moved to the fallback mount, and then
  automatically recaptured when the original source stream returns.

-Burst-On-Connect-

  This is an new, optional config setting which will send a initial burst of 
  data to connecting listeners.  This has the effect of reducing 
  (significantly) the startup buffer latency from the end-user perspective.  
  This option is enabled by default.


****New Enhancements for 2.1****

-Update to admin interface-

  This interface has been cleaned up quite a bit and made a bit nicer.

-Rewrite of the YP listing code-

  The icecast yp code has received a complete overhaul by karl, and it's a much
  more stable and failure-resistant implementation.

-Lots and lots of bugs fixed-

  Check the ChangeLog for a complete list of these...
